# 🪼 LOOM: Da Code Editor

Welcome to **LOOM** – the only code editor that glows so hard, your desktop might need sunglasses😎! Powered by Tauri, React, and a healthy disregard for boring UIs.

## Features

- **Cyberpunk Glow**: Every pixel is neon. Every token is a party.
- **Window Transparency**: See your desktop, your cat, or your existential dread
right through the editor.
- **Custom Title Bar**: Because rectangles are for spreadsheets.
- **JellyFish/GlowPunk Themes**: Your code has never looked this electric.
- **Monaco Editor**: Like VS Code, but with more attitude.
- **Open/Save/Save As**: For when you actually want to keep your work.
- **Window Controls**: Minimize, maximize, close – all with style.
