# 🪼 LOOM: The Cyberpunk Goofy Code Editor

Welcome to **LOOM** – the only code editor that glows so hard, your desktop might need sunglasses! Powered by Tauri, React, and a healthy disregard for boring UIs.

## Features

- **Cyberpunk Glow**: Every pixel is neon. Every token is a party.
- **Window Transparency**: See your desktop, your cat, or your existential dread right through the editor.
- **Custom Title Bar**: Because rectangles are for spreadsheets.
- **JellyFish/GlowPunk Themes**: Your code has never looked this electric.
- **Monaco Editor**: Like VS Code, but with more attitude.
- **Open/Save/Save As**: For when you actually want to keep your work.
- **Window Controls**: Minimize, maximize, close – all with style.

## Getting Started

2. `npm install`
3. `npm run tauri dev`
4. Put on your shades. It's about to get bright.
